# CoreDova
 A Simple Cordova HTML Framework

 I try to create HTML framework for using with Cordova, so we can manage our header, footer and page easily.
 Please enjoy! :D
 
# Structure 
1. www
 - index.html (Main HTML Page)
2. core

 - coredova.css (Main CSS Theme)

 - coredova.js (Main JS Function)
3. plugins (Plugin for Theme)
4. pages

- Each page has page.css (Custom CSS Syle for Page), page.js (Custom JS Function for Page, as we known as controller), page.html (HTML for Page - Content)
